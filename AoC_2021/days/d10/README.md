# AoC 2021, Day 10

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - find errors in parenthesis orders (part 1) [0.003 s]
  - complete the incompete lines and calculate score (part 2) [0.004 s]

This one was fairly simple. I was a lot of list parsing and comparing. I used quite a few dictionarys
for mapping symbols to each other, assigning points, etc.
Just a lot of loops and lists. I was able to finish both parts within a couple hours (off and on), so
overall quick quick.

Day Rating: 6/10
  (simple, but fun to solve quickly)
