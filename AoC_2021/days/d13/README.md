# AoC 2021, Day 13

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - count the number of dots left after the first fold (part 1) [0.17 s]
  - complete all of the folds on a transparent paper and read the letters (part 2) [0.1 s]

This was a fun one and pretty easy. Overall it took me an hour or so to solve. No special programming
skills. Just some loops and such. I like reading out ASCII-type art to find a solution, but it made
the test script not quite accurate in confirming the result. No need to optimize - they both solved
pretty quickly. Probably most of this time was even just in the printing.
