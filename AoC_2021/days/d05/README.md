# AoC 2021, Day 5

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - plot lines and count overlapping (hoirz and vert only) (part 1)
  - same as above, but include diagonals (part 2)

First real mapping problem of they year. Pretty fun! I got a bit mixed up with the zero-indexing
for part 1, but wasn't too hard to correct for. Part two was pretty quick, but not too elegent
of a solution. I ended up having four sections of code that would run for each direction of the
diagonal lines. solutions ran in 0.4 and 0.5 seconds, so no need to really optimize. I think a lot
of that run time was actually printing out useless stuff. Didn't take too long to solve these.
