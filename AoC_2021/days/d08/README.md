# AoC 2021, Day 8

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - count characters of a certain length (part 1) [0.003 s]
  - decrypt a set of digits coming in to a 7-light display (part 2) [0.03 s]

I spent a lot of time with pen and paper on this one, and a while stuck trying to figure
out how to find the uncommon digits between THREE lists. It wasn't as simple as using sets
and intersecting them. Overall it was a nice challenge, but I just got too bogged down. The
solutions aren't glamerous, but they work.
