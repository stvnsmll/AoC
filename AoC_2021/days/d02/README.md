# AoC 2021, Day 2

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - navigate submarine based on input instructions (part 1)
  - instructions changed slightly (part 2)

Still quite simple, but it's still ealry in the month. It was fun to have such a short puzzle, but
leaves me wanting more. Just used some for loops again and had a few counters that kept track of
the submarine's position and aim. Took me about 5 minutes to solve the puzzles, and the solutions
ran in about 0.002 seconds, so no need for optimization


Day Rating: 3/10
  (honestly a bit too easy, especially compared with how 2018 started)
