# AoC 2021, Day 4

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - bingo game, find the board that will win first (part 1)
  - bingo game, find the board that will win last (part 2)

It was pretty fun, I got to use OOP which was nice. I spent a looong time trying to figure 
out how to parse the input. #embarassing
I was stumped because I thought the answer was the sum of the row that completed, not the
unmarked squares on the board, so that was also frustrating. The solution ran in 0.13 seconds
so no ned for optimizing. Overall still basic programming skills. Utillized OOP (class for
the boards with various methods that can act on each object). It took me half the day (off and
on), but that was mainly beacuse I was stuck on some easy stuff.
