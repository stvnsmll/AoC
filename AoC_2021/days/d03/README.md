# AoC 2021, Day 3

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - count digits in their locations in binary numbers (part 1)
  - do more of the above but more processing of it (part 2)

Part 2 ran pretty quick (0.01 seconds), but the code could probably have been reduced
and made more simple with helper functions and some while loops instead of for loops.
Honestly the amount of tricky reading and understanding to figure out what part 2 was
trying to describe made it take a while for how simple it actually was.

I usually like working with the binary numbers, but this seemed a little tedious.
Working with the binarys was really just string manipulation.

Day Rating: 2/10
  (seemed like too much reading for too simple of a problem)
