# AoC 2021, Day 1

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - count increasing values in a list (part 1)
  - count increasing sets of (sums of 3) in the same list (part 2)

Simple introduction to programming fundamentals.
Used for loop to loop through all of the numbers in part 1.
Used 2 for loops to first get a list of sums of 3, then count incrementing again in part 2.

Quite a simple start to AoC this year. Excited for more!
