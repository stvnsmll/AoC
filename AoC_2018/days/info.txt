Each day has its own folder.

Inside each day folder, there are the following:
   - a puzzle input file, 
   - the solution .py codes (for the 2 parts),
   - a README.md file for the post-solution discussion that discusses:
        - the challenge statement
        - what was fun
        - what was hard
        - what skills were used (data types, programming approaches, etc)
        - how long it took me to solve it ()
        - puzzle ranking (1-10) of how much I enjoyed it
