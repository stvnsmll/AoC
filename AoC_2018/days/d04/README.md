# AoC 2018, Day 4

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - order a list of guard sleep times, and find the most sleep guard and their most sleepy minute (part 1)
  - find the guard that is most likely to be asleep at a given minute (part 2)

This one had a lot of string splicing at the beginning and timestamp manipulation.
Overall pretty fun, but had to break the problem down into so many steps. Used OOP, and a lot of class methods.

The solution runs in 0.05 seconds, so no need to optimize.

Day Rating: 5/10
