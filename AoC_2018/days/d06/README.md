# AoC 2018, Day 6

Challenge Statement Summary:
  - find enclosed area in a map based on input coordinates (part 1)
  - calculate distances from each point to each coordinate and find minimums (part 2)

This was a pretty fun map problem, especially because it is an infinite map. It was a nice challenge 
for part 1, but part 2 was pretty easy. The second part really didn't need to be stored in a map
format either

The solution runs to part 1 runs in 11 seconds, but I didn't feel like trying to optimize. Part 2 runs
in 4 seconds.

Day Rating: 6/10
