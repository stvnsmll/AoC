# Advent of Code: stvnsmll
This repo stores all of my past and current Advent of Code solutions.

>[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar and can be solved using any programming language. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code))

2019 was the first year that I heard about AoC, and I was just beginning to get more comfortable with Python. It was a great learning opportunity and I completed 11 of thr 25 puzzles, getting 19 stars that first year. (Some of my solutions were done on my phone or in a web-based IDE, so I still need to gather all of the 2019 work and document it here.)

In 2020, I was able to secure all 50 stars (by mid-January). I also focused a bit on testing my code too. I created a simple testing framework so that I could quickly test the sample input before running my larger input. Completing the CS50 online course earlier in 2020, I was a bit more prepared to handle the larger puzzles with more efficiency (like using the best type of data structures for example).

Just before December 2021, I went back to start some of 2018 for practice (and to setup the real testing framework for
unittest).

My focus for 2021 will be to use a Python testing framework (maybe unittest), and structure it a bit more like a real project.
